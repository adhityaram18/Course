Adhitya Ram

Module Name: Algorithm Analysis

Learnings:
In this module, I learned how to evaluate the performance of algorithms using time and space complexity.
I understood the importance of Big O, Big Ω, and Big Θ notations for describing algorithm efficiency.
The module helped me compare different algorithms based on their growth rates.
I also learned how to analyze best, worst, and average case scenarios for various algorithms.
